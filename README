Short readme on the following contents.

These sub-folders were merged from a different set
of folders and therefore lost a lot of history.

These are all projects for algorithms-I.  Most are
in python, some in C.

Currently:

1. Counting inversions.  Given a list of numbers, count
   the number of inversions.

2. A randomized quick sort implementation in Python.

3. A selection algorithm to find Nth smallest number.

4. Min-cut algorithm.  Given a txt file describing a
   non unidirectional graph, finds the minimum cut
   of the graph.
